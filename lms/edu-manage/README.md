# EduManage

Full-stack course management system built with MERN. Students enroll in courses, submit assignments, track attendance and grades. Instructors create/manage courses, grade submissions, and track student progress. Admins verify instructors, approve courses, and oversee platform.

## About The Project

EduManage is a complete educational management platform addressing the need for streamlined course and student management in institutions. It combines role-based access control with a modern, intuitive interface where students discover and enroll in courses, instructors manage content and assess work, and administrators oversee the entire ecosystem. The project demonstrates full-stack architecture with secure authentication, file handling, and real-time dashboards.

## Built With

- React 18, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, Axios, React Hot Toast, Heroicons
- Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcryptjs, Express Validator, Multer

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm or pnpm
- MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tumansutradhar/edu-manage.git
   cd edu-manage
   ```

2. Backend setup
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure backend environment (`.env`)
   ```
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/edumanage_db
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here_make_it_long
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
   ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@edumanage.com
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=SecureAdminPassword123!
   ADMIN_FIRST_NAME=System
   ADMIN_LAST_NAME=Administrator
   EMAIL_FROM=noreply@edumanage.com
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
   MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
   UPLOAD_PATH=./uploads
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. Start backend
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Frontend setup (new terminal)
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

App runs at http://localhost:3000.
